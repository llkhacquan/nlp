A tool for manipulating instance lists of feature vectors.
--help TRUE|FALSE
  Print this command line option usage information.  Give argument of TRUE for longer documentation
  Default is false
--prefix-code 'JAVA CODE'
  Java code you want run before any other interpreted code.  Note that the text is interpreted without modification, so unlike some other Java code options, you need to include any necessary 'new's when creating objects.
  Default is null
--config FILE
  Read command option values from a file
  Default is null
--input FILE
  Read the instance list from this file; Using - indicates stdin.
  Default is -
--output FILE
  Write pruned instance list to this file (use --training-file etc. if you are splitting the list). Using - indicates stdin.
  Default is -
--training-file FILE
  Write the training set instance list to this file (or use --output if you are only pruning features); Using - indicates stdout.
  Default is training.vectors
--testing-file FILE
  Write the test set instance list to this file; Using - indicates stdout.
  Default is test.vectors
--validation-file FILE
  Write the validation set instance list to this file; Using - indicates stdout.
  Default is validation.vectors
--training-portion DECIMAL
  The fraction of the instances that should be used for training.
  Default is 1.0
--validation-portion DECIMAL
  The fraction of the instances that should be used for validation.
  Default is 0.0
--random-seed INTEGER
  The random seed for randomly selecting a proportion of the instance list for training
  Default is 0
--prune-infogain N
  Reduce features to the top N by information gain.
  Default is 0
--prune-count N
  Reduce features to those that occur more than N times.
  Default is 0
--prune-document-freq N
  Reduce features to those that occur in more than N contexts.
  Default is 0
--min-idf NUMBER
  Remove features with inverse document frequency less than this value.
  Default is 0.0
--max-idf NUMBER
  Remove features with inverse document frequency greater than this value.
  Default is Infinity
--vector-to-sequence [TRUE|FALSE]
  Convert FeatureVector's to FeatureSequence's.
  Default is false
--hide-targets [TRUE|FALSE]
  Hide targets.
  Default is false
--reveal-targets [TRUE|FALSE]
  Reveal targets.
  Default is false
