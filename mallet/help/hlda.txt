  Default is false

  Default is null
--config FILE
  Read command option values from a file
  Default is null
--input FILENAME
  The filename from which to read the list of training instances.  Use - for stdin.  The instances must be FeatureSequence or FeatureSequenceWithBigrams, not FeatureVector
  Default is null
--testing FILENAME
  The filename from which to read the list of instances for held-out likelihood calculation.  Use - for stdin.  The instances must be FeatureSequence or FeatureSequenceWithBigrams, not FeatureVector
  Default is null
--output-state FILENAME
  The filename in which to write the Gibbs sampling state after at the end of the iterations.  By default this is null, indicating that no file will be written.
  Default is null
--random-seed INTEGER

  Default is 20
--num-levels INTEGER
  The number of levels in the tree.
  Default is 3
--alpha DECIMAL
  Alpha parameter: smoothing over level distributions.
  Default is 10.0
--gamma DECIMAL
  Gamma parameter: CRP smoothing parameter; number of imaginary customers at next, as yet unused table
  Default is 1.0
--eta DECIMAL
  Eta parameter: smoothing over topic-word distributions
