Suppose  a disk  driver othas 5000 cyclinder number 0 to 4999.The drive is currently serving a request at cyclinder 143 and the previous request at cylinder 125the queue of pending request in order is 86,1470,913,1774,948,1509,1022,1750,130 .
Start from currently head position ,what is the total distance that’s disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending request of each following algorithm
