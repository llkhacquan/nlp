1.14 a. Show that if M is a DFA that recognizes language B, swapping the accept
and nonaccept states in M yields a new DFA recognizing the complement of
B. Conclude that the class of regular languages is closed under complement.
b. Show by giving an example that if M is an NFA that recognizes language
C, swapping the accept and nonaccept states in M doesn’t necessarily yield
a new NFA that recognizes the complement of C. Is the class of languages
recognized by NFAs closed under complement? Explain your answer.
